# Redis Experiments

In this repository I want to test redis running in containers and different functionalities of it. I will run three main experiments:

1. Running one Standalone Redis container
2. Running a sentry setup with one master, two replica and three/five sentinel nodes
3. Running the sentry setup in a swarm setting with hostnames instead of IP
